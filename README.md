<h1>Instructions</h1>
<h2>Create two user-defined exceptions (name your own exceptions)  that validate number of login tries of a user with a password.  User is only allowed up to maximum of 3 tries.  If user already exceeds the third try, a user-defined exception will handle it.  If user has entered an invalid password, another user-defined exception will handle it.  Make "password" as the valid password. <br/><br/>Upload your URL link solution in your GitHub repository. Make a separate repository for this assignment.</h2>
